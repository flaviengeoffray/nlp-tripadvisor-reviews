         "This is my favorite hotel in Chicago, and I've stayed at all the top luxury properties (Four Seasons, Hyatts etc). I've stayed at this hotel 20+ times, it's a hidden gem. Right on the lakefront, there's a beach across the street from the hotel, and if you get a lake view room (be sure to ask), you'll spend some quality zen time gazing at the water. Regardless of which room you get, you can leave your window shades open because you have beautiful views in every direction plus no one overlooking you. \nRooms are fantastic - I love the clever, well-designed furniture and fittings, simple, minimal, and very well-designed. Honey-colored lighting plus a multiplicity of window treatments (blackout shades plus twig shades plus sheer sun shades) means that you can adjust the lighting to make yourself feel cheerful and relaxed. The bathroom is gorgeous, plus clever 'window' out to main room means excellent ventilation and light. \nThe huge lobby is my favorite hangout in Chicago. The ground-floor location means you're connected to the street-level location and yet the plush chairs, sofas etc mean that you totally zen out and relax. I always try to conduct business meetings in the lobby - plenty of space, beautiful room and excellent food/drinks menu and service means that my guest invariably remarks 'wow, this is a great place, I've never been here before.' I've won almost every negotiation conducted in the lobby, ply your opponents with drinks plus finger food plus a terry cloth robe and they will give you all that you want :)\nAlso love the staff - they totally deal with whatever questions I have or help that I need. This is an EXCELLENT hotel for BUSINESS travelers, the staff is exceptionally helpful running meetings, handling phone calls etc. And special shout-out to the car valet staff and doorman staff - Chicago can be incredibly cold, but the staff always has your car (or taxi) warmed up and waiting for you, I've never met better service. Ever. The front desk also have my airplane boarding passes printed out when I come down to check out, plus a pre-visit call means they will help you maximize spg points etc.\nStay here every time you visit Chicago.",

The room was pre-paid and the hotel ended up charging me twice for the one night stay and have still yet to rectify my bill. The hotel is pretty expansive, but the decor needs serious updating and the elevators are extremely sketchy. There were a few times I thought I'd be spending hours in them getting up and down the tower. The rooms are of good size, but the windows make you feel like you're staying in a post-Soviet building as they are tiny concrete slits, at least in the tower portion.

The continental breakfast was a perfect start to the day providing bagels, toast, cereal, yogurt, and fresh fruits. We are looking forward to returning.",

We got a great deal on the room ($134/night) through my corporate travel agent. It was very conveniently located to all the Downtown DC museums and attractions, super hip without feeling overly swanky, so we weren't terrified that the boy would do lasting damage. We were given tickets for a free continental breakfast for one morning and a $10 \"raid the mini bar\" voucher. the only drawback was the $40/night parking fee. Even though we could have taken the car out as often as we would like, there was no need to drive. if I had been smarter about it, I would have found a nearby garage for half the price.

The AC could not be changed from cold to hot, even though temperatures outside would drop into the 30s at night.

After waiting in the lobby for about 15 minutes, we found out from the firemen we could go up (again, not a word from the workers).

         "This hotel is in a great location. Really near the heart of Boston’s downtown. We stayed in their king suite over the three day weekend. The king suite was roomy, clean, and well maintained.\nThe nice points of this place:\n1. Great Location: It is in the middle of everything. So you can walk to just about anything and the fantastic service! The hotel was only a short walk from the Boston Aquarium and Faneuil Hall, which has a variety of places to eat and shopping. Easy access to the T stop from government center.\n2. Quincy market, Boston harbor, and great restaurants are within walking distance. AND it's very quiet in the night despite of its great location!\n3. Several pubs and places to eat around within a block of the hotel which is always nice. This was nice since we got in late, and still had plenty of available places to eat after a flight. \n4. The manager went out of his way to help make our stay comfortable.\n5. The staff was very friendly and helpful.\n6. The rooms were clean.\n7. The bed was comfortable, as were the pillows.\n8. Breakfast at Nix’s Mate was good and the scrambled eggs with potatoes were nice. However, the breakfast did fill up fast and there were frequent lines and longer waits when we chanced too late. \n9. They have roll away bed available for children. \nThe Cons:\n1. No swimming pool.\n2. No room refrigerator, just a unit that keeps things chilled. \n3.

Upon check in the girl was very nice and told me that she would be putting us in a double. I asked if there was any king beds available and she said yes but it was a $30 upcharge. I thought it was a bit much but I agreed to pay the upcharge. We were put on the 32nd floor with a city view. The view was nice but thats all I can really say about this room. First of all, I'm 5ft 4 and I was able to reach up and touch the ceiling! It made the room feel VERY cramped. The furniture in the room was chipped and worn/rundown in general. The bathroom is so small and the walk in shower has 1 glass door leaving the back of the shower open. I think they are trying to be chic but my husband froze while taking a shower. There is a pass thru opening in the bathroom with run down wooden shutters to close for privacy...wierd layout. The beds were not too bad but we have had better. The windows have blackout shades that are dirty/frayed and then wooden blinds to cover those which were dirty/outdated. Not Impressed at all with this hotel. Bottom line is we will not be returning to The W Lakeshore, there are many other choices out there.",

Front desk was thankfully efficient, as it was already 1030pm and i didn't have dinner yet. The rooms are all indeed suites, with a seperate living area, but it's not 5 star or anything.

         "Residence Inn is great hotel chain on the whole. My family always tries to find one when we visit a new US state. There's always comfort, complimentary food, good wifi, a kitchen complete with a tea/coffee service, stove, fridge/freezer, dishwasher & cupboard with dishes. Great if you want to buy groceries & cook your own meals to save money or have a late night snack. \nWhat made this DC location great was that it was a few blocks away from a lot of the main attractions & great restaurants. The hotel supplied me with a four-paged handout list of all nearby restaurants. An added plus is that this particular Residence Inn is right next to a pharmacy that also sells groceries, so everything you need for your room is a few feet away from your door.\nService was great, everyone who worked there was helpful & mannerly. The glass door of the closet was accidentally shattered when we tried to squeeze a huge suitcase into the closet. The front desk sent a repairman to our room to check it out, he left & returned with a new glass door to install and in 12 minutes it was as if nothing had happened. What was even nicer was the fact that the hotel didn't charge our room for the accident.\nI definitely recommend this hotel, especially if you are traveling with family or friends. Just know that they charge (as of April 2012) $29 a night for parking AND that there's a height restriction because the parking lot is underground. Unfortunately, the huge jeep that we rented was too tall to fit into the RI lot, so we had to park up the road in another hotel's parking lot for $32/night. \nIf you can help it, save the cash & don't rent a car at all - regardless of which you hotel you stay in, unless you plan on exploring in your car outside of DC into the wider DMV area. Between the rental fee & insurance and parking fees both at the hotel and around the main streets & major spots in downtown DC, it adds up. Walking is healthier anyway. lol",

Between the rental fee & insurance and parking fees both at the hotel and around the main streets & major spots in downtown DC, it adds up. Walking is healthier anyway. lol",

A comment from a friend when I sent a picture of the room to him was spot on: “It looks like a country inn hotel in England in the 70’s”. Where the service was okay the food was terrible (fat & greasy and the breakfast omelette must have gained me 2 pounds + wasn’t finished cooking and the French fries for my burger came out of frost bags), the water in the room you actually had to pay for (new experience for me, and costly at about $4 a bottle), the showerhead was fixed on the wall at about 180cm and I am 195cm so it wasn’t too easy to shower and my bill was wrong when it appeared under the door (this was corrected by the time I checked out though). I don’t know what the price for the competing hotels are but $370 for two nights and one burger with cola and two breakfasts just isn’t worth it when you top it up with being quite a noisy hotel (you can hear people in the halls and when they flush in their room).",

Fortunately, there was a light blanket in the closet. \nService could not have been better. Staff members were amazingly helpful, friendly, and knowledgable about the area.

Later when the in-room telephone misbehaved, a hotel employee was promptly there to fix it. A front desk clerk knew just where to find a nearby self-serve carwash. When the TV was blaring in the breakfast room, we were able to get the sound turned down. During our visit, we bought a new camera and accidentally trashed the camera box with the strap inside. Our garbage had just been taken out, so we asked if we could check the trash. A staff member volunteered to check the garbage, and he found the box, retrieved the strap, and had it delivered to our room in very little time!\nBonuses included the freshly baked cookies at the front desk and DVDs to check out for free (the rooms have DVD players).",

         "BRILLIANT hotel, my #1 Chicago pick for business and pleasure\nThis is my favorite hotel in Chicago, and I've stayed at all the top luxury properties (Four Seasons, Hyatts etc). I've stayed at this hotel 20+ times, it's a hidden gem. Right on the lakefront, there's a beach across the street from the hotel, and if you get a lake view room (be sure to ask), you'll spend some quality zen time gazing at the water. Regardless of which room you get, you can leave your window shades open because you have beautiful views in every direction plus no one overlooking you. \nRooms are fantastic - I love the clever, well-designed furniture and fittings, simple, minimal, and very well-designed. Honey-colored lighting plus a multiplicity of window treatments (blackout shades plus twig shades plus sheer sun shades) means that you can adjust the lighting to make yourself feel cheerful and relaxed. The bathroom is gorgeous, plus clever 'window' out to main room means excellent ventilation and light. \nThe huge lobby is my favorite hangout in Chicago. The ground-floor location means you're connected to the street-level location and yet the plush chairs, sofas etc mean that you totally zen out and relax. I always try to conduct business meetings in the lobby - plenty of space, beautiful room and excellent food/drinks menu and service means that my guest invariably remarks 'wow, this is a great place, I've never been here before.' I've won almost every negotiation conducted in the lobby, ply your opponents with drinks plus finger food plus a terry cloth robe and they will give you all that you want :)\nAlso love the staff - they totally deal with whatever questions I have or help that I need. This is an EXCELLENT hotel for BUSINESS travelers, the staff is exceptionally helpful running meetings, handling phone calls etc. And special shout-out to the car valet staff and doorman staff - Chicago can be incredibly cold, but the staff always has your car (or taxi) warmed up and waiting for you, I've never met better service. Ever. The front desk also have my airplane boarding passes printed out when I come down to check out, plus a pre-visit call means they will help you maximize spg points etc.\nStay here every time you visit Chicago.",

         "Would Avoid If Possible\nLet me start with the positives, although there were only a few. The location for the Sheraton is pretty much the best part of this hotel. You are right on 16th street and in the middle of everything and can get just about anywhere. The concierge was extremely helpful in getting me where I needed to be outside of denver through public transportation in lieu of the wildfires shutting down a lot of the regional service. Now onto the bad stuff. I came to check in and they did not have my reservation. Even though I had my confirmation number and copy of my reservation sheet. There happened to be a sorority convention staying at the hotel, but to not be able to accommodate because of high volume of guests is completely subpar for a large hotel chain. After asking to speak with a manager as the clerks told me I didn't have a room, I was finally cleared to check in. The room was pre-paid and the hotel ended up charging me twice for the one night stay and have still yet to rectify my bill. The hotel is pretty expansive, but the decor needs serious updating and the elevators are extremely sketchy. There were a few times I thought I'd be spending hours in them getting up and down the tower. The rooms are of good size, but the windows make you feel like you're staying in a post-Soviet building as they are tiny concrete slits, at least in the tower portion. Best bed I've slept in though, which was somewhat redeeming. I'm more dissatisfied with the customer service of this hotel than anything else, and for this reason alone I would recommend staying far away from this place and booking elsewhere.",

Having said that, the rooms are finished nicely, and what you get is an efficient and comfortable space, not unlike many european hotels (which is the first thing I thought of when I entered my room). The only thing I could find fault with was that there is no ironing board in the room. Otherwise, everything works fine.

There was no make up mirror, or full length mirror which was disappointing.

I couldn't find any breakfast. Then the bill. I was charged $3 for the internet - you will be charged if you use or not. The final insult was when I asked if we could stay in the room for an extra hour before leaving for the airport. $50 for an hour! I felt that I was being treated like dirt. There are a lot of hotels out there, and I would avoid this one like the plague. The real bonus were the down-and-outs who live outside the front. They were great people to talk to, and it was fascinating to see them all gather when the free food and clothes hand-outs arrived. Great people. Sad for the girl who got beaten up the night of our stay. The Police sorted it out pretty quickly! Finally - the roof terrace (advertised). Great view, nothing up there but a few tatty chairs.",

Very large open lobby area with a bar in the middle. The pool was clean and nice to relax in the sun while the kids played in the pool. Pool side food service was quick and was not to expensive. They had a limited outdoor menu, but asked for options and you could have whatever you wanted. It did get a little bit noisy being next to the airport, that would be the one downside. Outdoor area had nice world music playing and hot tub as well. Overall great value.",

         "Philly Fantastic\nThe Rittenhouse is a fantastic place to stay. If you're looking for a very attentive staff, great food and clean comfort accommodations, The Rittenhouse is the place. My wife and I stayed hear with a Museum/Room package. The staff was so nice and attentive. We ordered room service several times. The response time was remarkable. The food was amazing. Our room was spacious, clean and well equipped. It's a little pricey, but worth every single penny. I used the gym, which was very nice. They also have a great indoor pool. \nThe area is very nice. The hotel is right on Rittenhouse square, a nice park which is safe and well maintained. It's a great neighborhood for shopping as well. The location is Philly is perfect for heading off in various directions for whatever your interests are. \nWe will definitely be back.",

         "busy hotel\nNo major complaints. Were checked in within a short time and were pointed to the elevators, but not told which ones to take to our floor (2 sets of elevators for 2 separate floor ranges). Provided us with a fold-out bed but the blanket was pretty sorry, especially for November temperatures. They did provide a second thicker one, but it didn't help much. The AC could not be changed from cold to hot, even though temperatures outside would drop into the 30s at night. The breakfast that you could buy at the hotel was entirely too expensive, but since it's right next to the Grand Central Station, all you have to do is walk over there to the Dining Concourse and grab yourself something reasonably priced. \nOn our last night there the fire alarm went off. The concierge didn't bother answering the phone and none of the workers made any announcements as to whether this was a serious situation or not. After waiting in the lobby for about 15 minutes, we found out from the firemen we could go up (again, not a word from the workers). AFTER, we got to our rooms, the alarm kept going off and announcements kept coming in that firemen were still trying to reset the alarm, etc. \nWe got a good deal to stay at the hotel, but i was not really impressed.",

         "Stay Away!!!\nMy first indication of what the hotel would be like should have been the shuttle van. Dirty, old and raggedy. The hotel is exactly like the shuttle van. Smells like smoke and urine. Filthy carpeting. This place is supposed to be 3.5 stars. Nope. 2 is the best I can give it. The pictures on their website have to be at least 10 years old.\nI'm supposed to be here for a week. I tried to get a refund, but I messed up and prepaid for this trap through Expedia. They agreed to refund my cheap days but not the really expensive first day. \nThe furniture is dirty and cheap and has smoke burns. The shower is moldy. I changed rooms, but the 2nd is exactly like the first except it isn't on the 1st floor. The first floor rooms have a regular door to the outside and don't feel secure at all. And they have window air conditioners!!\nThey offer free breakfast, but I would be totally afraid to eat anything cooked here. The rooms do have new microwaves and refridgerators, but I don't want to eat in my room either.\nTo be fair, the front desk person and the shuttle driver were very pleasant.",

The king suite was roomy, clean, and well maintained.\nThe nice points of this place:\n1. Great Location: It is in the middle of everything. So you can walk to just about anything and the fantastic service! The hotel was only a short walk from the Boston Aquarium and Faneuil Hall, which has a variety of places to eat and shopping. Easy access to the T stop from government center.\n2. Quincy market, Boston harbor, and great restaurants are within walking distance. AND it's very quiet in the night despite of its great location!\n3. Several pubs and places to eat around within a block of the hotel which is always nice. This was nice since we got in late, and still had plenty of available places to eat after a flight. \n4. The manager went out of his way to help make our stay comfortable.\n5. The staff was very friendly and helpful.\n6. The rooms were clean.\n7. The bed was comfortable, as were the pillows.\n8. Breakfast at Nix’s Mate was good and the scrambled eggs with potatoes were nice. However, the breakfast did fill up fast and there were frequent lines and longer waits when we chanced too late. \n9. They have roll away bed available for children. \nThe Cons:\n1. No swimming pool.\n2. No room refrigerator, just a unit that keeps things chilled. \n3. The bathroom grout could have been a bit cleaner.",

I can not recall staying in a hotel anywhere that I ate at multiple times during our stay..especially when so many options nearby. This was our first trip to Austin, and thanks to the great stay we had, as well as excellent service, we will be back for sure. We chose Austin as was between family members homes we were visiting, but instead we stayed in Austin most of the time! Especially wanted to thank and recognize Will, out front in shuttle/valet.

         "Not Impressed...\nMy husband and I just stayed overnight at The W Lakeshore. I actually bid on a hotel room through Priceline and was given a room at the W. Upon check in the girl was very nice and told me that she would be putting us in a double. I asked if there was any king beds available and she said yes but it was a $30 upcharge. I thought it was a bit much but I agreed to pay the upcharge. We were put on the 32nd floor with a city view. The view was nice but thats all I can really say about this room. First of all, I'm 5ft 4 and I was able to reach up and touch the ceiling! It made the room feel VERY cramped. The furniture in the room was chipped and worn/rundown in general. The bathroom is so small and the walk in shower has 1 glass door leaving the back of the shower open. I think they are trying to be chic but my husband froze while taking a shower. There is a pass thru opening in the bathroom with run down wooden shutters to close for privacy...wierd layout. The beds were not too bad but we have had better. The windows have blackout shades that are dirty/frayed and then wooden blinds to cover those which were dirty/outdated. Not Impressed at all with this hotel. Bottom line is we will not be returning to The W Lakeshore, there are many other choices out there.",

         "Learnt many lessons\nAfter I landed at o'hare airport and started my search for the renaissance, my lessons started. Firstly i looked up the wrong section in tripadvisor for an airport hotel; on hindsight i should have searched in \"rosemont, illinois\", rather than \"chicago, illinois\" . After i walked past the hilton in the airport on my way to the blue line on the \"L\", my regret started. At the L station, the station workers told me to go to P1 instead where they have hotel buses pick us up. You may be wondering why i never called ahead to ask. Well, this is a strange hotel with no phone number on their website. And of course, they never replied my email. I should have seen the red flags. Unfortunately for me again, by the time i saw their number at the bus bay and called them, i just missed the hotel bus and had to wait for another 30mins in the cold. Go to door 2 by the way\nThis \"airport hotel\" is a rather far 20min away from o'hare airport and the entrance is a very strange, small and non-descript door. Front desk was thankfully efficient, as it was already 1030pm and i didn't have dinner yet. The rooms are all indeed suites, with a seperate living area, but it's not 5 star or anything. The shower stall is large, but the 2 tvs smaller than Apple mac screens. The sink seems to leak, and there's no bathrobe. Room service was ok\nWill try the airport hilton next time",

The staff went out of their way to make us feel welcome and did whatever was within their power to make the event incredible and memorable. I expected a bit of \"snobbery\" since this was in Beverly Hills but was pleasantly surprised that this was not the case in this hotel.

         "Great but beware of parking issue\nResidence Inn is great hotel chain on the whole. My family always tries to find one when we visit a new US state. There's always comfort, complimentary food, good wifi, a kitchen complete with a tea/coffee service, stove, fridge/freezer, dishwasher & cupboard with dishes. Great if you want to buy groceries & cook your own meals to save money or have a late night snack. \nWhat made this DC location great was that it was a few blocks away from a lot of the main attractions & great restaurants. The hotel supplied me with a four-paged handout list of all nearby restaurants. An added plus is that this particular Residence Inn is right next to a pharmacy that also sells groceries, so everything you need for your room is a few feet away from your door.\nService was great, everyone who worked there was helpful & mannerly. The glass door of the closet was accidentally shattered when we tried to squeeze a huge suitcase into the closet. The front desk sent a repairman to our room to check it out, he left & returned with a new glass door to install and in 12 minutes it was as if nothing had happened. What was even nicer was the fact that the hotel didn't charge our room for the accident.\nI definitely recommend this hotel, especially if you are traveling with family or friends. Just know that they charge (as of April 2012) $29 a night for parking AND that there's a height restriction because the parking lot is underground. Unfortunately, the huge jeep that we rented was too tall to fit into the RI lot, so we had to park up the road in another hotel's parking lot for $32/night. \nIf you can help it, save the cash & don't rent a car at all - regardless of which you hotel you stay in, unless you plan on exploring in your car outside of DC into the wider DMV area. Between the rental fee & insurance and parking fees both at the hotel and around the main streets & major spots in downtown DC, it adds up. Walking is healthier anyway. lol",

This hotel was formerly a Westin and I was told by the staff that Marriott came in and updated the lobby and rooms. Hotel is slow and the city center closed for the most part on the weekend...although the ice rank was open for use. The hotel staff was friendly and eager to please. \n*FYI-The valet parking option is 24.90 with tax. \n*The hotel is in the Arts District of Dallas with many options available for the guests. Our room faced Downtown on the 15th floor and we could hear sirens at one point, although I am sure that is common in a downtown environment.\n*The air conditioner did blow on the bed all night which I do not like, but others might enjoy.

I found the hotel was tired, dark and had really poor food. A comment from a friend when I sent a picture of the room to him was spot on: “It looks like a country inn hotel in England in the 70’s”. Where the service was okay the food was terrible (fat & greasy and the breakfast omelette must have gained me 2 pounds + wasn’t finished cooking and the French fries for my burger came out of frost bags), the water in the room you actually had to pay for (new experience for me, and costly at about $4 a bottle), the showerhead was fixed on the wall at about 180cm and I am 195cm so it wasn’t too easy to shower and my bill was wrong when it appeared under the door (this was corrected by the time I checked out though). I don’t know what the price for the competing hotels are but $370 for two nights and one burger with cola and two breakfasts just isn’t worth it when you top it up with being quite a noisy hotel (you can hear people in the halls and when they flush in their room).",
